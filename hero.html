<center><img src="images/Luke.png" width="400"></center>

<h4><p> This individual was one of the leading roles in the famous film called "star wars" he was known as a "Jedi" or part of the "light side". Luke fought for the good in the world and in all wanted to see the good in the galaxy, whether that meant going through physical pain to help others or to just help himself and make himself a better person for the greater good. Luke also had a loving but complicated family with his parents and his sister, Princess Leia. at first, they did not know they were siblings but fought crime and evil together side by side, then when the time came they found out and were extremely profound. His parents were loving(or were they?) and supported almost everything he did except something that put him at risk of getting hurt. He grew up in a very small town on a far planet, he was on the more poor side but was gifted with great teachers and the ability to work with.</p></h4>


<h4><p> I choose this character because I feel that he was very persistent in every task that came his way, he did things such as protecting his dad, killing for the greater good, or even running away from his own family just so that they would not get hurt and to protect them. He is also an amazing person because his own father betrayed him for the dark side but still loved him. That just shows how loving and kind Luke is, this happened when Lukes's father made some bad decisions and choices while being perswaded onto the dark side. However even when luke had his own arm cut off he never gave up on him and it worked out in the end. All in all luke skywalker is just a great person for his many amazing attributes.</p></h4>
