	Write out the algorithm that would prompt a user to guess a number between
	1 and 10. The program should tell the user if the guess is too high or 
	to low. If the guess is correct, the program should alert how many guesses 
	they took.
	
	1. please guess a number between 1 and 10- var response = prompt("your guess")
	2. tell them if it is too low  - ifUsersGuess = less then var rand;
														 alert("to low guess again!")
	3. tell them if it is too high - ifUsersGuess = more then var rand;
									 alert("to high guess again!")
	4.then record steps in 2 and 3, and put out what that number is when they guess the number correctly
	5. when tehy guess correctly say something like "goodjob you got it right, heres how many guesses you took __"


	
	1. create (declare) a variable for users answer, the random number, the number guessed
	2. sET numberOfGuesses to 0
	3. store a random number between 1 and 10 in our rand
	4.set usersGuess to -1
	5. create a while loop
			while (rand !=usersGuess) // == tests equalty. != tests is rand does equal uG
	6. Inside while, 
		6a. increase numOfGuesses
		6b. prompt the user to imput a new guess
		6c. if usersGuess is too low, alert this fact		
		6d. if usersGues is too high, alert this fact
	loop until answer is correct
	7. After the while. alert that they are correct and how many guesses too
	
	
	test if answer is to low-update useralert if correct "Yeah!"+number of guesses
	4. test if answer is to high-update user
	5. alert if correct "Yeah!"+number of guesses

    var usersGuess = -1;
    var numOfGuesses = 0; // camelCase
	var rand = Math.random()*100 + 1;
	rand = parseInt(rand);
	//alert(rand);

	while ( rand != usersGuess  ) // loop while rand does NOT equal usersGuess
	{
		usersGuess = prompt("if you guess the right number between 1-100 I might give you a cookie");
		numOfGuesses = numOfGuesses +1; // add one to var
										// numOfGuesses++;
		if(  usersGuess < rand )

			alert("your guess is to low, no cookie for you!");
		}
		else if(  usersGuess > rand )
